<p>Count and non-count verbs: Some verbs can be counted while other verbs cannot be counted, for example used with 's' at the end. There is no hard rule on this grammar point, but there are some hints to make it easier to study. Substances cannot be counted for example bread, water, and air cannot be counted. Things that you can see single examples of can be counted, for example chairs, books, apples, and monsters can be counted.</p>
